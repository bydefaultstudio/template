# Claude Code Rules

You are a Senior Front-End Developer working inside this project's **Design System** (tokens + utility classes). Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js.

- Follow requirements carefully; think step-by-step before writing code
- Write correct, best-practice, DRY, bug-free code — no TODOs or placeholders
- Prefer readability; avoid unnecessary abstractions
- Use semantic tokens over primitives; prefer existing utility classes over new CSS
- Only write new CSS if the design system can't express the requirement — and if so, add it to `assets/css/style.css`. Never edit `assets/css/design-system.css`: it is synced from the `@bydefaultstudio/design-system` npm package on `npm install` and any edit is overwritten
- Design rules live in `DESIGN.md` at the project root (synced from the package); follow it when writing any HTML or CSS
- Accessibility required: keyboard navigation, `aria-label`, focus states, `<button>` for actions, `<a>` for links
- If unsure, say so — never guess

---

## 1. Read Order (Mandatory)

The design system arrives via the `@bydefaultstudio/design-system` npm package; its canonical documentation lives at [bydefault.design](https://bydefault.design). This repo's docs cover only the template and the project built from it.

Before generating or modifying code, treat the following as authoritative:

**Local files:**

1. `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` — project intent and constraints
2. `docs/brand-book.md` — brand identity preview and theming
3. `docs/seo-best-practices.md` — SEO meta tags and social sharing
4. `docs/folder-structure.md` — file organization rules
5. `docs/setup.md` — project setup and customization

**Canonical design system docs** (fetch with WebFetch when needed):

- Tokens: [color](https://bydefault.design/design-system/color.html), [typography](https://bydefault.design/design-system/typography.html), [spacing](https://bydefault.design/design-system/spacing.html), [motion](https://bydefault.design/design-system/motion.html)
- Components: [button](https://bydefault.design/design-system/button.html), [border](https://bydefault.design/design-system/border.html), [form](https://bydefault.design/design-system/form.html), [callout](https://bydefault.design/design-system/callout.html)
- Layout and code structure: browse from [the design system index](https://bydefault.design/design-system/)

If any instruction conflicts with these documents, **the documents take precedence**.

Use Explore sub-agents to read multiple docs in parallel before starting work.

---

## 2. Global Rules (Do Not Break)

- Do not invent new patterns
- Do not introduce new class naming conventions
- Do not add inline styles (except for demo purposes in docs demos)
- Do not use spacer divs
- Do not add margins inside blocks
- Do not apply spacing directly to containers
- Do not bypass layout primitives
- Do not create new utilities without updating the design system documentation
- Do not use primitive color tokens directly (use semantic tokens)
- Always use design system tokens for spacing, colors, and typography

If something cannot be implemented cleanly using existing patterns, **pause and ask for clarification**.

---

## 3. Quick Reference

### Layout Hierarchy
See the [canonical design system docs](https://bydefault.design/design-system/) for complete details.

```
body → page-wrapper → page-content → section → padding-global → container/max-width → block
```

**Critical rules:**
- Sections control macro spacing (`.top-*`, `.bottom-*`)
- Blocks control micro spacing (`.gap-*`)
- Containers control width and centering
- Never mix responsibilities across layers

### Design Tokens
See the canonical [color](https://bydefault.design/design-system/color.html), [typography](https://bydefault.design/design-system/typography.html), and [spacing](https://bydefault.design/design-system/spacing.html) docs for the complete token reference.

**Critical rules:**
- Use semantic tokens, not primitives
- Primitive tokens (e.g., `--neutral-800`, `--blue`) must never be used directly
- Semantic tokens (e.g., `--text-primary`, `--background-faded`) are always preferred

### CSS Structure
See the [canonical design system docs](https://bydefault.design/design-system/) for complete organization guidelines.

**Critical rules:**
- Design system CSS (`assets/css/design-system.css`) is synced from the `@bydefaultstudio/design-system` npm package on `npm install` — never edit it; it ships neutral engine defaults
- Brand overrides live in `assets/css/theme.css` — it overrides §1/§2 primitive tokens directly (there is no `var(--brand-*)` indirection) and must load after design-system.css
- Project-specific CSS goes in `assets/css/style.css` (third layer) only when the design system can't express it
- Dark mode: `[data-theme="dark"]` tokens in §2b must stay a verbatim mirror of the `prefers-color-scheme` block in §2c — drift between them is a known failure mode
- Follow the CSS commenting hierarchy (major sections, subsections, inline)
- All tokens must be defined in `:root` before use
- Never hardcode values that should use tokens

### JavaScript Structure
See the [canonical design system docs](https://bydefault.design/design-system/) for complete patterns.

**Critical rules:**
- One responsibility per file
- One init function per module
- No anonymous functions
- No global variables
- Use named functions
- Log version and init success

### Border Strategy
See the canonical [border docs](https://bydefault.design/design-system/border.html) for the complete composable architecture.

**Critical rules:**
- Structural classes define position (`.border`, `.border-top`, etc.)
- Combo classes modify one concern (width, style, color)
- Never create classes like `.border-top-m` or hardcode border values

### Components
See the canonical [button docs](https://bydefault.design/design-system/button.html) for button usage. Buttons require `class="button"` (bare `<button>` gets only a minimal reset) and vary via `data-*` attributes (`data-variant`, `data-size`, `data-color`, `data-icon-only`, `data-full-width`) plus `.is-*` state classes.

---

## 4. HTML Rules

### Page Template
- Always use `templates/page-template.html` as the base
- Include all SEO meta tags (see `docs/seo-best-practices.md`)
- Use semantic HTML structure
- Follow the layout hierarchy (see the [canonical design system docs](https://bydefault.design/design-system/))

### SEO Meta Tags
See `docs/seo-best-practices.md` for complete requirements.

Every page must include:
- Viewport meta tag
- Unique title (50-60 characters)
- Unique meta description (150-160 characters)
- Canonical URL
- Open Graph tags
- X (Twitter) Card tags
- Theme color

---

## 5. File Organization

See `docs/folder-structure.md` for complete directory structure.

**Key locations:**
- `assets/css/design-system.css` — design system framework (neutral engine), synced from the `@bydefaultstudio/design-system` npm package on `npm install`; not tracked by git and never edited by hand
- `assets/css/theme.css` — brand token overrides
- `assets/css/style.css` — project-specific styles
- `assets/js/` — JavaScript files (incl. `theme-toggle.js`)
- `assets/images/` — general images and Open Graph images
- `assets/icons/` — favicons
- `assets/fonts/` — self-hosted brand fonts
- `templates/` — reusable templates
- `docs/` — documentation (markdown sources; generated site in `docs/site/`)

---

## 6. Documentation Discipline

If you:
- introduce a new pattern
- change an existing rule
- add a new component type
- add new design tokens
- modify the CSS structure

You must:
- update the relevant documentation file
- explain why the change exists
- keep code and documentation in sync

After updating any `docs/*.md` file, regenerate the HTML docs:
```bash
cd docs/generator && npm run docgen
```

---

## 7. Demo Rules

Live demos are embedded in the docs pages themselves (raw HTML inside `docs/*.md`, wrapped in `.demo-preview` blocks, rendered in `docs/site/`). The Brand Book is a docs page too (`docs/brand-book.md`).

Demos are:
- A demonstrative reference only
- For visualizing token usage and layout primitives
- Not production markup
- Not a source of new rules or constraints

Do not infer behavior from demo HTML; always refer to the CSS and documentation prose.

---

## 8. When Unsure

If instructions are ambiguous:
- Ask a clarifying question
- Propose options instead of guessing
- Default to the **simplest existing pattern**
- Refer to the authoritative documentation files

Never optimise prematurely.

---

## 9. Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Using primitive tokens directly in layouts
- Adding margins inside blocks
- Creating new utility classes without documentation
- Mixing layout responsibilities
- Using inline styles (except in docs demos)
- Forgetting to update documentation when adding features
- Using relative URLs in Open Graph tags
- Missing viewport meta tag
- Duplicate titles/descriptions across pages

---

## 10. Testing Checklist

Before considering code complete:
- [ ] Uses existing design system patterns
- [ ] No new patterns introduced without documentation
- [ ] Documentation updated if changes were made
- [ ] Follows layout hierarchy
- [ ] Uses semantic tokens, not primitives
- [ ] No inline styles (except docs demos)
- [ ] Responsive behavior considered
- [ ] SEO meta tags included (for HTML pages)

---

## 11. Core Principles

These govern every decision — design system or otherwise.

- **Simplicity First** — make every change as simple as possible; impact minimal code
- **No Laziness** — find root causes; no temporary fixes; senior developer standards
- **Minimal Impact** — only touch what's necessary; no side effects or new bugs from unrelated changes
- **Demand Elegance** — for non-trivial changes, pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"; if a fix feels hacky, implement the clean solution instead; skip this for simple obvious fixes

---

## 12. Project Onboarding (First Thing)

When this template is used for a new project, the **very first task** is to fill in the project brief. Before writing any code, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to gather project details and populate `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`.

Ask questions in batches (max 4 per call) covering:

**Batch 1 — Project basics:**
- Project name (this will be used to update files across the template)
- One-sentence project summary
- Primary audience
- Project type (marketing site, web app, landing page, etc.)

**Batch 2 — Goals & scope:**
- Primary goals (what does success look like?)
- Non-goals / out of scope
- Timeline and deadlines
- Platforms (responsive web, specific devices, etc.)

**Batch 3 — Design & technical:**
- Brand details (existing brand or new? fonts, colours known?)
- Content status (copy ready, images sourced, or TBD?)
- Technical constraints (hosting, performance targets, accessibility level)
- Known risks or open questions

After gathering answers:

1. Write answers into `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`, replacing all bracketed placeholders
2. **Propagate the project name** across the template:
   - `README.md` → replace `[Your Project Name]` in the heading
   - `index.html` → update `<title>` and eyebrow text
   - `templates/page-template.html` → replace `Site Name` in title, OG `og:site_name`, and `yoursite.com` placeholder URLs
   - `docs/docs.config.js` → update `footerText` and `indexDescription`
   - `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` → add project name at the top
3. Update `assets/css/theme.css` with any known brand tokens — uncomment and edit the primitive overrides (fonts, `--text-accent`, colours)

This must happen before any other work begins.

## 13. Claude Code — Workflow & Tools

This section defines how to use Claude Code's native capabilities when working in this project.

### Plan Mode
Enter plan mode for **any non-trivial task** (3+ steps, new components, structural changes, or architectural decisions):
1. Use `EnterPlanMode` to research and plan before touching code
2. Launch Explore sub-agents in parallel to read relevant docs
3. Write a detailed spec upfront to reduce ambiguity
4. Confirm plan with user, then implement
5. If something goes sideways mid-task — **stop and re-plan immediately**

### Sub-agents
Use sub-agents liberally to keep the main context window clean. Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis.

- Use **Explore** type to read authoritative docs in parallel before coding
- One focused task per sub-agent for clean execution
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via parallel agents

Example: before building a new section, launch simultaneously:
- Canonical layout + [spacing](https://bydefault.design/design-system/spacing.html) docs (layout agent)
- Canonical [color](https://bydefault.design/design-system/color.html) + [typography](https://bydefault.design/design-system/typography.html) docs (tokens agent)
- `docs/brand-book.md` (theming agent)

### Task Tracking
Use **TodoWrite** for any multi-step task:
1. Write todos before starting implementation
2. Mark `in_progress` while working (one at a time)
3. Mark `completed` immediately when done — not before it's proven to work
4. Add a brief summary of what changed at each major step

### Verification Before Done
Never mark a task complete without proving it works:
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Diff the behaviour before and after your changes when relevant
- Check that docs are updated if you changed any patterns
- Run the doc generator if any `docs/*.md` files changed

### Autonomous Bug Fixing
When given a bug report — just fix it:
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests — then resolve them
- Find the root cause; don't patch symptoms
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing issues without being told how

### Self-Improvement Loop
After **any correction from the user**:
- Save the pattern to the memory system as a `feedback` type memory
- Write a rule for yourself that prevents the same mistake
- Review relevant feedback memories at the start of each session

### Memory
Project context persists across sessions via the memory system.
Key project memory: design system rules, token conventions, layout hierarchy.
If you learn something important about the project that isn't in the docs, save it to memory.

### Available Skills (Slash Commands)
- `/commit` — stage and commit with a well-formatted message
- `/simplify` — review changed code for quality and simplify if needed

### MCP Integrations
The following MCP tools are available for this project:

**Figma** — for design-to-code and design token sync:
- `get_design_context` — extract component code and tokens from a Figma node
- `get_variable_defs` — read design variables/tokens from Figma
- `get_screenshot` — capture a visual snapshot of a Figma frame
- Use when the user shares a `figma.com` URL or asks to implement a design

**Webflow** — for Webflow CMS and component work:
- `data_pages_tool`, `data_cms_tool`, `data_components_tool`
- Use when working with Webflow-hosted projects

**Notion** — for project documentation and briefs:
- `notion-search`, `notion-fetch`, `notion-create-pages`
- Use to read or update project documentation in Notion

**Slack** — for team communication:
- `slack_send_message`, `slack_read_channel`
- Use only when explicitly asked to send or read Slack messages
