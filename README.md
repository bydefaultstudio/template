# [Your Project Name]

This project uses a structured design system and layout architecture for building consistent, maintainable front-end experiences.

## Overview

This project includes:

- A complete **design system** with tokens, utility classes, and components — shipping neutral defaults, with dark mode built in
- A **brand theme** (`assets/css/theme.css`) for per-project visual identity (fonts, colours, logo)
- Clear **layout and spacing rules** for consistent page structure
- Documented **best practices** for CSS, JavaScript, and HTML

## Getting Started

1. Run `npm install` — this syncs the design system CSS from the `@bydefaultstudio/design-system` package into `assets/css/design-system.css`
2. Review `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` for project goals and requirements
3. Follow the [Setup guide](docs/site/setup.html) to customize brand colors, fonts, and logo
4. Explore the [Documentation](docs/site/index.html) for design system details
5. Browse the design system docs (with live demos) — start at the [Design System Overview](docs/site/design-system-overview.html)
6. Check the [Brand Book](docs/site/brand-book.html) to see the current brand identity
7. Start building pages at the repo root — edit `index.html`, copy `templates/page-template.html` for new pages, and keep css/js/images in `assets/`

> **Note on the lockfile:** this template deliberately ignores `package-lock.json`, so a project created from it resolves the newest compatible design system version at first install. Once your project is under way, feel free to commit your own lockfile for stability.
